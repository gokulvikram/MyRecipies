You will need skewers for this recipe, so if you use wooden ones be sure to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before you grill!

Prepare the pasta – boil the pasta according to the package directions.
Cook the shrimp and tomatoes – while the pasta boils, thread the tomatoes and shrimp onto skewers. Brush each with olive oil and then sprinkle the salt, pepper, and garlic over the shrimp. Grill the shrimp and tomatoes for 3 to 4 minutes, turning occasionally, until the shrimp are pink and opaque and the tomatoes have softened.

Make the sauce – melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the drained linguini plus 1/4 cup of the water that you boiled it in. Toss the pasta in the butter sauce to coat it evenly.
Bring it all together – remove the shrimp and tomatoes from the skewers and toss them with the pasta. Garnish the shrimp pasta with chopped fresh basil and grated Parmesan.

GRILLED SHRIMP & TOMATO PASTA FAQS!
If you have any additional questions comment below and we will do our best to answer your questions!

DO I HAVE TO GRILL THE SHRIMP AND TOMATOES?
No grill? No problem! You can cook the shrimp and tomatoes in a skillet on the stove instead. You can use a cast-iron skillet or regular skillet. Just heat it up and sautee them in the butter until the shrimp are pink and the tomatoes have softened. Add the pasta, reserved pasta water and toss to combine!

HOW LONG SHOULD YOU COOK SHRIMP?
How long you cook the shrimp depends on how big your shrimp are, but generally shrimp cook in approximately 4 to 8 minutes. Medium-sized shrimp will be on the lower end of that scale and jumbo shrimp will be on the higher end. The best way to tell if shrimp are fully cooked is to look at them!  Shrimp that are fully cooked will be opaque and pink in color.

HOW DO YOU NOT OVERCOOK SHRIMP?
The best way to avoid overcooking shrimp is to not leave them alone while they’re cooking! While cooking them pay attention to the color of the shrimp. Once they turn pink and opaque (raw shrimp are gray and a bit translucent) they are done. If you are not planning to eat the shrimp right away you can submerge them in an ice bath to stop the cooking process so they don’t overcook.


WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHRIMP AND PRAWNS?
Shrimp and prawns are two different things! Prawns are larger than shrimp, have different bodies and anatomies, and are a fresh-water crustacean. Shrimp are smaller with a different shape and body and are salt-water crustaceans. If you substitute prawns for shrimp in this recipe the cooking time will be different since they are so much bigger.

WHAT DOES SHRIMP SIZE MEAN?
Have you been confused by the numbering on shrimp? Me, too! Once I figured it out it’s made buying shrimp so much easier! Most shrimp are labeled with a “count” like 21/25 count or 51/60 count, among others.

This count number tells you approximately how many shrimp are in a pound. Higher count shrimp means they are smaller while larger count shrimp are bigger. So, 51/60 count shrimp means there are approximately 51 to 60 shrimp in a pound. This means they are smaller in size compared to 21/25 count shrimp. Understanding this count number will help you choose the right-sized shrimp for your recipes.
